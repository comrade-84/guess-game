# guess-game
this project consist of how to use basic javascript knowledge to manipulate the guess game.
we make use of the (math.random()) method to randomly generate a random number
this randomly generated number is compared to the user input value using the if and else statements
if the number match, the user wins the match else the user have to guess more.
user has 20 chance to win the game.
with each guess fail, the score decrease using the decrement operator
the highscore is recorded from the longest streak from the score.
